## About me

I am a Phd student in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) department at Columbia University since September 2019. Prior to joining Columbia, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique, Paris with a B.S and M.S degree in Applied Mathematics. My research interests include optimization and online learning under uncertainty. I am currently working with Vineet Goyal on dynamic pricing and multi-armed bandits problems.
